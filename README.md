# PINN-code
This repository is used to store the code reproduction of the papers I have read

If it’s useful for you, give me a star, please!

## To-do

- add config to modify PDEs
- add more models
- plotting with MATLAB
- upload a handbook

## Workflow

My workflow is based on PyCharm 2024.3 and MATLAB R2024a. All code is run on an ASUS TUF Air 2024 (华硕天选 Air 2024) with the following hardware configuration:

```
CPU	AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 w/ Radeon 890M 2.00 GH
GPU NVIDA Geforce RTX 4060 Laptop
RAM	32.0 GB (31.1 GB usable)
OS Ubuntu 24.10
```

And the Python requirements are as follows:

```
Python 3.11.10
torch 2.5.1 
CUDA 12.4 
scipy 1.14.1
```
For more details, please refer to `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.
